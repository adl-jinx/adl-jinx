# About Me

Hello there! I'm Antonio De Luca! 🙋‍♂️🌍

A humble enthusiast at heart, I'm currently navigating the thrilling universe of technology, with a special focus on coding. My journey draws from a colorful palette of experiences across anti-fraud, finance, tourism, and customer service, crafting a multifaceted professional identity that I am proud of. I planted my first seeds in the field of programming in 2021, and by 2022, I was knee-deep in hands-on experience. 🚀 

Presently, I'm straddling the domains of Computer Science as my major and Management, as my minor, trying to create a unique blend of the two in my skill set. 🎓💼

## 👣 My Journey Beyond The Profession 🗺️ 

If I were to encapsulate my life experience, I'd probably say, "I've seen it all." I've lived, worked, and breathed the culture of North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia, and I have left my footprints in many more countries (although I miss Africa 😒). Each experience has been a chapter in my life, shaping who I am today. 

Join me in this remarkable journey as I continue to learn, grow, and contribute to the world of technology! 🚀 🌎 🌍 🌏
