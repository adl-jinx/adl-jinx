# About Me

Hey yoo there! if you jumping here means you wanna know me ;).

Well, right now I am at my second life attempt. The previous one ended in the late 80s, I was at the top of the world and the toast of Wall Street, I was having whisky with Boesky[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Boesky] and cookies with Milken[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Milken].

But hey, I spawned back in the world as an Italian boy, with a Fendi bag[https://www.ebay.com.sg/itm/374777006534] filled with dreams, love, and adventures...
