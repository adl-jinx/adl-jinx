# 👋 About Me

Hey yoo there! If you’re jumping in here, it means you wanna know me. 😎

Well, right now I’m on my **second life attempt**. The previous one ended in the late '80s — I was at the top of the world and the toast of Wall Street. 🥃📈

I was having whisky with [Boesky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Boesky) and cookies with [Milken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Milken). 🍪💼

But hey, I spawned back into the world as an Italian boy 🇮🇹 — with a [Fendi bag](https://www.ebay.com.sg/itm/374777006534) filled with dreams, love, and adventures... 💼✨❤️
